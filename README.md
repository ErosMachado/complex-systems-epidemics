# Complex Systems and Epidemics Modeling

This repository contains the physical and mathematical modeling of epidemics and complex systems using Python. The project explores fundamental concepts of complex systems and applies them to simulate the dynamics of epidemics on networks. 

## Overview
The primary objective of this project is to understand how network structures and varying parameters influence the spread of epidemics. Through simulations, we analyze how factors like transmission rates (λ) and recovery times (τ) shape epidemic behaviors and explore scenarios like progressive and regressive outbreaks.

### Key Features:
- **Network-Based Epidemic Modeling:** Simulations based on real-world network structures.
- **Parameter Analysis:** Impact of varying transmission rate (λ) and recovery time (τ).
- **Custom Scenarios:** Including progressive and regressive epidemics, as well as negationist dynamics.
- **Python Implementation:** Efficient and modular codebase for reproducible results.
